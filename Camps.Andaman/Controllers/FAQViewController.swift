You have to complete the form with your name, contact details, number of persons attending the summer camp, age, and best time to get in touch. One of our executives will contact you to provide a complete overview of the events and pricing structure.","The participants are divided on the basis of their age group. In order to ensure safety, the smallest age group considered for this event is 14, and the maximum is 35. ","During this event, we will try to cover most of the unique and picturesque locations in Andaman and Nicobar Island. Since the event also encompasses trekking and visiting numerous places, there is no particular stay in one place, but it will be organized in reputed lodging.","It will be 21 days.","Most of the time, it will be greenery and vegetarian food. Along with that, non-veg food is also served to keep children strong and healthy.","Morning yoga, meditation sections, swimming, snorkeling, boat ride, trekking, a night stay in the Jungle, study tour across Barren Island and Mud volcano, meeting with freedom fighter family, and much more in the list.","Presently, forty members are expected in a single batch, which is further divided into different groups. Each group is monitored and handled by a single counsellor/group leader.","Once the camper is registered and undergone the on-site medical test, an email will be sent to the respective persons with a detailed packing list. It may vary as per the program, and the backpack will be selected as per the weather and outdoor activity.","No! We don't expect any training session from participants. But, they have to submit their health concern certificate and participate in the health camp conducted by our team.","The detailed itinerary details will be mailed to the participants' email and a hard copy, which contains all the details regarding summer camp, is provided once they book or enter the campsite.","Yes, we will allow contacting the parents once a day. During emergency conditions, permission is provided to increase the contact number and report the status to parents on a timely basis."]
